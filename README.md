## Overview

This project is for NTU 2021 FALL Personal Communication System final project, the goal is using [simPy(3.0.13)](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.13/index.html) to simulate the paper's handoff model, evaluate performace matrix.

Simulated paper: A. Xhafa and O. K. Tonguz, "Dynamic priority queueing of handoff requests in PCS," ICC 2001. IEEE International Conference on Communications. Conference Record (Cat. No.01CH37240), 2001, pp. 341-345 vol.2, doi: 10.1109/ICC.2001.936959.
